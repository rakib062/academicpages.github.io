Sharing memes (image macros) on social media have become very popular in recent years. But if the memes are made out of ordinary people's photos then they may violate privacy of those people as their photos are circulated without their consent, and worse, the memes often portray defame the subjects, and may have devastating psychological, social, and professional consequences. In this paper, we study how people's humor type---propensity of using humor for self-entertainment and/or social interactions---relate to meme-sharing behaviors. Furthermore, we employed two behavioral interventions and studied how people with different humor types respond to such interventions.
