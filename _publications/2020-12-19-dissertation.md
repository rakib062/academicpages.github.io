title: "A SOCIO-TECHNICAL APPROACH TO PROTECTING PEOPLE'S PRIVACY IN THE CONTEXT OF SHARING IMAGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA"
venue: 'Indiana University'
excerpt: My dissertation explores a socio-technical approach to protect our privacy in the context of sharing images online, when <u>we are not in full control over sharing our visual data</u>. It proposes machine learning-based technical solutions to detect and obfuscate sensitive image contents, as well as behavioral interventions to encourage social media users to respect and protect others' privacy.
