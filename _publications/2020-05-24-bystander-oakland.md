excerpt: People often appear as other (usually unknown) peoples' photos as <i>bystanders</i>, and when these photos are shared online, they pose great privacy threats towards them, especially during an era when advances in machine learning enables adversaries to automatically search, identify, and track people utilizing huge image databases available in the cloud. We propose a machine learning model to automatically detect <i>bystanders</i> in an image, so that they can be obfuscated before before posting that photo online.
