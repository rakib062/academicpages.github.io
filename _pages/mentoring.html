<strong>Research</strong>
<br/>
	I am affiliated with the <i>Center of Excellence for Women in Technology (CEWiT) </i> and <i>Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC)</i> at <i>Indiana University</i>. Each semester I mentor at least two undergraduate students in a research project, which helps them in getting hands on experience in scientific methods. At the end of each semester, the students have to present a poster at a competition and submit a report. In summer 2016, my team  won the <strong>best poster award</strong> in summer interns poster competition.

 <strong>Development</strong>  
 <br/>
 I led a team including two other students in <i>Inter University System Design and Development Competition-2011</i> and our team was the <strong>champion</strong>. In the competition we developed a three-tier web based application to fulfill specified business requirements in ASP.net platform, using state of the art design patterns and system architecture.
