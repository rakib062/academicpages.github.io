Hi there! 
I am Rakib. I am a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://cispa.de/en">CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</a>. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~kapadia/">Prof. Apu Kapadia</a>. Prior to that I obtained my bachelor in Computer Science from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2012.

Research Summary
======
 
<p>
	My research goal is to help people better manage <u>their own</u> and avoid harming <u>other people's</u> privacy while sharing images on online social media platforms.
</p>

<p>
	The first half of my research is concentrated on developing tools and techniques to detect and obfuscate sensitive content in images using computer vision and machine learning. In the second part, I am studying people to understand how they process visual data at the psychological level and make decisions about privacy management while sharing images. With this knowledge, I aim to develop intelligent systems to help people to be mindful about their own as well as other peoples' privacy and make more rational decisions to reduce privacy risks.
</p>

<p>
	I am also interested in complex social network analysis, with a focus on measuring how the agents in such systems react to external stimuli emerging from their interactions and change their behaviors.
