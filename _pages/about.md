Hi there! 
I am Rakib, a fifth-year Ph.D. student at the Dept. of Computer Science, Indiana University.  My thesis advisor is <a href="https://www.cs.indiana.edu/~kapadia/">Prof. Apu Kapadia</a>. Before coming here I obtained my bachelor in Computer Science from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2012.

Research Summary
======
 
<p>
	The goal of my Ph.D. research is to help people better manage <u>their own</u> and <u>other peoples'</u> privacy while sharing images on online social platforms.
</p>

<p>
	The first half of my research is concentrated on developing tools and techniques to detect and obfuscate sensitive content in images using computer vision and machine learning. In the second part, I am studying people to understand how they process visual data at the psychological level and make decisions about privacy management while sharing images. With this knowledge, I aim to develop intelligent systems to help people to be mindful about their own as well as other peoples' privacy and make more rational decisions to reduce privacy risks.
</p>

<p>
	I am also interested in Complex Systems and Network Science. I am leading a separate project where I study the effects of positive and negative stimuli on behavioral changes in large social networks.
