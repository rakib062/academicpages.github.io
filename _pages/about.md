Hi there! I am Rakib, a fourth year Ph.D. student at the Dept. of Computer Science, Indiana University, Bloomington. Before coming here I completed my bachelor in Compute Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.

My research interest
======
I study human perception and behavior, primarily in the context of privacy and security, using both experimental and observational data. Recently my research work is concentrated on modeling how people make privacy decisions when sharing images in the social media platforms, and developing tools that would help them more mindful about their own as well as other peoples' privacy. As such, my research is at the intersection of privacy, computer vision, machine learning, cognitive science, and psychology. Read more at the Projects page!
